title: "Smell the coffee, please"
description: "There are a few moments which are exactly like the way monks describe as they sit in their monasteries sitting in a Lotus position. Smelling the coffee this way is similar to one such moment for me."

If you ever need a break from everything else, if you are looking for a moment of utmost bliss, if you reach a breaking point, if you feel like the world is a shitty place, watch this video on your 4K HDR display in fullscreen and make a cup of French Press coffee. Really focus on grinding the coffee. Do not grind it too much, you don't want an espresso. You are looking for that French Press texture. You are looking for that imperfectly perfect grounds. Smell the coffee. Just smell it, will you? Boil a cup of water and letting it cool down for a minute. Pour the water into the French Press and see the steam gushing out of the pot. Just observe the steam. Sit on your desk chair. Watch the pot as the coffee grounds start to dance in the pot. They look happy, don't they? They want to play in the water. They want to swim. Let them. Wait for 5 minutes before you press the piston downwards and extract the freshly brewed cup of coffee. Pour the brown bliss into your cup. Observe the waterfall. Just look at the beauty that is the coffee that you just made. Be patient. Take a sip. Isn't this wonderful? Didn't you just feel the utmost sense of calm? This, my dear friend, is life. This moment right here is life.
