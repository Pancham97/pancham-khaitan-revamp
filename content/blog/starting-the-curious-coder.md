I just published my first newsletter on Substack, and it's called The Curious Coder. You can find it by clicking on [this link](https://open.substack.com/pub/panchamk/p/the-curious-coder-1-charging-by-the?r=1thcb4&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true).

While I have been toying around with the idea of connecting with more people and sharing my thoughts for a while, something in me triggered today and pushed me to hit that Publish button.

I am feeling the butterflies in my stomach, and I like it. This makes me realise that I care about what I say and how I get perceived. I am sure I will stay true to my goal, and remain the source of signal in random strangers' inboxes.

Here's to many more!
