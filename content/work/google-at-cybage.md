### Background

[Brand Studio](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of-marketing/management-and-culture/google-marketing-brand-studio/) is Google's internal think tank that uses creativity, media, and technology to create experiences that connect Google products to the people who use them. My work, as a vendor, is to maintain and provide support, and introduce new features for the internal JavaScript library that provides the foundation to build websites for Google at scale.

### Work

While working on a JavaScript library that is being used by hundreds of developers to create thousands of Google-branded websites is super fun in and of itself, keeping it relevant for the masses is a tough nut to crack.

My tasks involve, but not are limited to,

- Updating the code to match requirements
    - Creating new components
    - Optimising and splitting code in a modular structure to be reused by other components
    - Building and testing code
    - Maintaining and fixing bugs in the existing code and follow a release cycle
- Writing documentation for the developers who use the library
- Interacting with the design team to enhance the experience, both in terms of developer experience and the end-user experience
- Creating an inclusive environment for the differently-abled people by focusing extensively on making the code accessible for all

Other than this, I get the opportunity to interact with developers who use the library to develop websites for Google and help them resolve their issues in order to make a wonderful product.

Technologies used:

- TypeScript, SCSS, HTML5, EJS, Markdown
- Jasmine, Karma
- Google Cloud Platform

### Results

The following websites are just some of the thousand more websites that utilise the power of the library that i am fortunate to be a part of.
