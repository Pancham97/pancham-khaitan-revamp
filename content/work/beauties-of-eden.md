Beauties of Eden is an initiative to empower women that are brokenhearted, less fortunate, affluent, successful, and career-driven back to the Eden, "The Presence of God," by organising workshops, conferences, retreats, mentoring and coaching to achieve this mission.

### Challenge

Creating an online presence for this lovely institute to help them reach to a wider audience. The message was clear: Make the website easy to navigate for people who were not too fond of reading. This meant that the content was image-driven. The text was concise and the images did most of the talking.

### Results

Built in the span of just a month, while a simple website at first glance, BoE packs quite a bit of backend where the visitor could share their story of how they found their way by being a part of this organisation. They could also send a query to the church if they ever wanted to host an event or collaborate in general. It also needed to have a way for the followers of the church to donate to the cause and help the institute function smoothly.

The website also contains a blog section where the admins of the institute could write their post directly from the website by entering their credentials, and the post will be made live instantaneously. Here's a quick walkthrough of the website...

### How we built this thing

Since the website was supposed to be snappy and quick, we resorted to using [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) as the killer combo for the UI. The routes were to be loaded quickly, so we used the highly recommended [React Router](https://reactrouter.com), and we used [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org) for state management.

The blog editing UI was built using [React Quill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-quill) and the blog data was stored in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). The admin login was created using [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).
